### Digital Humanities Work 

> **Postcolonial Paratext (Current Project)**– Working with Roopika Risam at Salem State University and Porter Olsen at the University of Maryland on a digital project exploring the new media paratext produced by postcolonial authors.  We seek to both preserve these paratexts and to situate them in broader discussions of power, epsecially race, gender, nationality, and class.  
> **The Center for Digital Equality at William and Mary (Current Project)**-Assisting with launching initiative to create a computational lab that deals with system inequality.  The lab is a partner with FemTechNet and will allow students to explore and critique digital culture and forms of scholarship.  In addition, I am a fellow at the center.  
> **Race, Memory, and the Digital Humanities Symposium (Current Project)**-Currently, helping to organize and serve on the host committee of a symposium related to racial inequality in the digital humanities.  
> **Data Mining the Culture Industry (Current Project)**-Current side-project that uses natural language processing to looks at lyrics in independent mixtapes versus commercial records to gain a statistical examination of the culture industry.  
> **Large Scale Data Analysis in Emotional History: A Case Study of the American Civil War**-Independently created project that used large-scale data analysis to understand emotional rhetoric during the American Civil War.  The corpus for the project consisted of approximately a hundred thousand New York Times and fifty thousand Richmond Daily Dispatch articles.  Later, I was provided an Early Researcher Grant by VolkswagenStiftung to present my findings at the Herrenhausen Conference in Hannover, Germany.  
> **Digital Atlas of American History (University of Richmond’s Digital Scholarship Lab)**-Assisted in conceptualizing the “Transportation” section of the Atlas in regards to technical infrastructure and theoretical framework.  The work was part of a larger research project to create a Digital Atlas of American History funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  
> **Digital Cover Scraper**-Independently created program that helps scholars scrape magazine, comic book, and news covers.  Findings were later published in *Gnovis: The Journal of Communication, Culture and Technology.*  
> **Digital Map Scraper (University of Richmond’s Digital Scholarship Lab)-Developed in-house tool to assist in the large web scraping of maps and images from the Library of Congress.  
> **Digital Humanities Reading Group**-Member of small reading group organized at The College of William and Mary designed to discuss theoretical shifts in the humanities dealing with the impact of the digital age.  
> **Minimal Computing**- Working group for Global Outlook::Digital Humanities that examines the implications of computing under constraints, such as in low-income communities and third world countries.  In addition, we also examine the power that low-cost devices have on academic research, and new ways to enhance pedagogy by incorporating ubiquitous computing devices into the classroom.
