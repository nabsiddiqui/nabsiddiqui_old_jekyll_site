I am a doctoral candidate in American Studies at The College of William and Mary. My research examines the intersection between the humanities and technology, with specific concentrations on the digital humanities, information studies, and the cultural history of media. Currently, I serve as a teaching fellow at William and Mary and am in the process of completing my dissertation, which examines the relationship between personal computers and the public/private sphere.
